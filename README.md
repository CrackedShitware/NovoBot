Found a this on some forum and decided tu build the builder for it.
Its really badly coded so its better that you dont even try to debug it.
Its using TDL (Turla Driver Loader) to bypass Windows x64 Driver Signature Enforcement. Its using compiled binaries, they dont eve bother to C+P the code.
For UAC bypass its using UACme also compiled binaries stored in resources.
